### Project Overview

**PLUGGED-IN-PROFITS** is a comprehensive platform designed to provide users with the latest news and data on stock markets, aimed at encouraging more people to invest. With only about 3% of Indians currently participating in the stock market, this platform seeks to raise awareness and make investment information more accessible. Our goal is to help bridge the gap in financial literacy and market participation, ultimately contributing to India's economic growth.

### Features

1. **News and Articles**: Stay informed with the latest news articles on stock markets and other user-defined topics, ensuring that shareholders remain updated on market events.
   
2. **Market Data**: Access real-time data on the top gainers, top losers, and most active stocks globally. A search bar is also provided for users to get detailed information on specific stocks, helping them assess potential risks and profits.

3. **Chat Messenger**: Engage directly with users via a chat messenger, where we address any queries related to the website and its features.

4. **Contact Form**: Users can reach out to us personally through a contact form, providing feedback and sharing their experiences on our website.
